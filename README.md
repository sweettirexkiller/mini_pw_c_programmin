# Welcome fellow students!

I encourage you to colaborate on the programming exercises from C Programming lectures at University. If you know how to use git and already have and account, then request access to code. 

 ##### How is this repo useful to you, my fellow student ? 
 
 I. You can clone it. 
 
 Your bash: 
````
 git clone git@github.com:sweettirexkiller/mini_pw_c_programmin.git
 cd mini_pw_c_programmin
````

II. You can see how the code works yourself. 

 ######Your bash: 
 
 Creating executable command 
````
gcc -Wall hello.c -o hello
````
And execute the compiled program.
````
$ ./hello
Hello, friend!
````


 
 
## Clean Code rules
 1) camelCase
 2) only english variables
 3) do as much comments as you can

Peter Yankievich, 

love XOXOXOXOXOXOX
